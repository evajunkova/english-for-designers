# Quiet cafe

Quiet cafe is the first cafe in Prague with deaf staff. The company has become a place where you can meet both worlds - hearing and deaf. Exhibitions, concerts and other cultural and educational events are held here regularly. Especially in the warmer months, you can look forward to a pleasant sitting in the garden.

## Summary

My project focuses on connecting the world of the hearing and the deaf. The most important think for me is the overall unification of visual immunity and the creation of marketing communication. I will create a new logo, posters, menu, uniforms and interier design for the company. This cafe is very special, because when you come inside you can't hear nothing. It is absolutelly calm and harmonic place.
