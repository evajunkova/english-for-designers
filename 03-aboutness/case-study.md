## My story

I live in Prague since I was a child. Already in elementery school I was very interested in illustrating and graphic design. My elementery school wasn't specialised in grafic design so I attended school of art every Thursday. I really enjoyed it. After elementery school I was very confused. I didn't know if I still wanted to continue with graphic design, but I gave it a chance. And now I am here! At this moment it is my third year studying in college of graphic design and creative communication. It is really funny, because after elementary school I wanted to be a criminalist or policeman. 


# Moser presentation 

I would like to introduce you my (not typical for me) recent project for glass shop MOSER. I got this big project from the manager from graphic design studio (Studio 66).

## Brief

In the beginning, they gave me some materials and information about brand. Also I cooperated with two girls from production. So we had little team for this project.

- Christmas identity and arrangement for Moser
- Staircase decoration, christmas wreaths
- Shop window decoration
- Snacks + punch cups
- Entrance space decoration
- No typical Christmas colors (no cones and flakes)

## Decorations

The company didn't want typical christmas colors and decorations. So I had to make something special. 

- Flowers: Eucalyptus, Buchsus, gold nuts
- Snacks = gold macaroons named moser, vanilla rolls
- Color pallette = dark green (eucalyptus), light green, gold, beige

## No time for stress

Manager gave me for this presentation only 2 days. These days were the most stressful days of my life, because I didn't have enought informations and materials for this presentation. 

## What this work gave me?

This work gave me suggestion that I am not a robot and I have personal live.
