# Moser presentation 

I would like to introduce you my recent project for glass shop MOSER. I got this big project from graphic design studio (Studio 66).

## Brief

In the beginning, they gave me some materials and information about brand. Also I cooperated with two girls from production. So we had little team for this project.

- Christmas identity and arrangement for Moser
- Staircase decoration, christmas wreaths
- Shop window decoration
- Snacks + punch cups
- Entrance space decoration
- No typical Christmas colors (no cones and flakes)

## Decorations

The company didn't want typical christmas colors and decorations. So I had to make something special. 

- Flowers: Eucalyptus, Buchsus, gold nuts
- Snacks = gold macaroons named moser, vanilla rolls
- Color pallette = dark green (eucalyptus), light green, gold, beige

## No time for stress

Manager gave me for this presentation only 2 days. These days were the most stressful days of my life, because I didn't have enought informations and materials for this presentation. 

## What this work gave me?

This work gave me new experience with arranging, graphic design and cooperation with people.
