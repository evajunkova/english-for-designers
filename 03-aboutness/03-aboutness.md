## My story

I live in Prague since I was a child. Already in elementery school I was very interested in illustrating and graphic design. My elementery school wasn't specialised in grapfic design so I attended school of art every Thursday. I really enjoyed it. After elementery school I was very confused. I didn't know if I still wanted to continue with graphic design, but I gave it a chance. After elementary school I started studying high school of graphic design (Náhorní). It gave me some experience.

And now I am here! At this moment it is my third year studying in college of graphic design and creative communication. It is really funny, because after elementary school I wanted to be a criminalist or policeman. 

My hobbies: gym (workout, running), drawing, arranging, interested in parrots
