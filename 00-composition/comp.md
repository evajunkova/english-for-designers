# Test


Short description

- There are six objects
- Five circles and one rectangle
- One of the circle is black and the rectangle is really thin
- All objects are in the same angle and plane
- The angle is about 45 degrees
- Inside the rectangle are four circles = three circles are on the left side and one on the right side (between three circles is one circle with black color)
- The last circle is on the right side, but outside the rectangle

HERE WE GO! :)
