This bachelor looks into vision communication ‘'Tichá kavárna’' in Prague. Tichá kavárna is the first coffe place in Prague which employs the deaf people (waiting staff). The coffee shop along with the sweet shop, catering and mobile cafe. The mobile cafe offers beer, homemade lemonade, coffee and various delicacies. The theoretic part concentrates mainly on visual style and image. It also includes the handicap definition. The goal is to get Tichá kavárna and whole issues about the deaf people closer to the public and lure more new customers in. The cafe does not concentrates only on the deaf people but also serves the wide public too. The theoretic part gives information about the main concept of the cafe shop, SWOT analysis, the deaf people difficulties and corporate identity. In the practical part I mainly focus on pictograms, merchandising and a redesigning the logo.
