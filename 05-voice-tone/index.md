# Voice & Tone 👩🏽‍💻

Every time I start presenting something to the client, I will prepare documents that will help me with the presentation. Preparation before the presentation is very important. During the presentation, it is the most important to feel confident and convincing. Everyone should also focus on their facial expressions, tone of voice and output.

## Voice

I try to conduct the presentation with calm and understanding. The presentation should not be just about reading slides, but about passing the topic on to the audience.

I always try to:
1. Be 100% ready on presentation
2. Be excited about the topic
3. Maintain eye contact with the audience
4. Always smile even when I'm nervous

## Tone

My tone is always the same. Even it is school presentation or presetation for big company. I think every presentation should be formal and interesting. At the end of the presentation is important to smile and be ready to answer some questions.
